# Machine Learning Final Project
Note: The code, data, and write-up is from the Spring 2023 semester. The following description of the project in new and was written for this upload. A more thorough discussion of decisions, proceedures, and analysys can be found in the included write-up.

For this final project, we were asked to implement multiple models-- a simple one to serve as a baseline, and a more promising,  sophisticated model. I chose to use logistic regression (log_reg_tornado.py) and decision trees (tree_tornado.py) to predict tornadoes, with little success. In addition to coding up the models and visualizations, a decent amount of time was spent ammassing the dataset, as the data that was detailed enough for my purposes was not in a easy-to-use (or standardized) file.
